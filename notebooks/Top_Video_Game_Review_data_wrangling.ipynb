    "[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/deepcontractor/top-video-games-19952021-metacritic) Game reviews are very personal to user experiences but what interests me is if there are any similarities between game summaries, and how well they perform based on user/metacritic reviews. We will also look into how many consules are in the dataset, are there any cult classics in the top video games, are there any genres of games, can we see any trends?\n",
